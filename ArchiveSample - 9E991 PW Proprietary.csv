System Account,0,8/24/15 10:06,"ISRO Ref: 123475 RSD Ref: 1333 V11510 IFSD/ATB Due to High Oil Temp Table of details: Date: 15-Aug-2012 Operator: Egypt Air (MSR) A/C: Reg SU-GCA / MSN2073 Position: #2 (RH) Engine: V11510 / Rating V2527 Time/Cycles: TT/TC 24234/11296 Regime: Cruise Event details: On 15-August 2012, during cruise an ECAM warning “ENG 2 Hi Oil” temperature was noticed by the crew. The pilot reduced the power, performed an engine shut down, and returned to the airport.  Troubleshooting was performed per the TSM without findings. A flight test was performed and a high oil temperature exceedence was reported again. Egyptair replaced the oil scavenge pump and the engine returned to service without issue until it was removed on 17-September 2012, due to a failed engine start. Conclusions of investigation: High Oil Temperature and subsequent commanded IFSD most likely occurred from an inefficient oil scavenge pump. With satisfactory service history and no known issues on this part number, no further action is required, the existing SIL 158 recommends a pump refurbishment at 25,000 hours. Tech Services will log the details of this event and continue to monitor the fleet. Available Information: · Post Flight Report DFDR Data · Vendor Scavenge Pump Efficiency Report Investigation findings: · Vendor Scavenge Pump flow test report showed that the Scavenge Pump was functioning below minimum flow requirements · No other issues were identified with the oil system Discussion: V11510 experienced an IFSD on 15 August 2012 and was subsequently removed on 17-September due to number 5 compartment coking. According to the PFR, V11510 experienced an IFSD for high oil temperature. Examination of the DFDR confirmed the oil temperature was not spurious and reached a maximum of 161 degree C.  This temperature resulted in the EEC setting the fault message “HMS-ENG OIL OVTMP“ and a commanded shutdown was performed in accordance with the FCOM. Troubleshooting was performed and the high oil temperature was resolved after replacement of the oil scavenge pump. No other issues were identified with the oil system. MSR reported the oil scavenge pump (P/N 4A7121, S/N FAA24649) accumulated 37,888 hrs since new and 20,786 hrs since overhaul. The removed pump was returned to the vendor and failed incoming test for flow below minimum requirement. The performance deterioration on the two critical stages of the pump range from -10.4% (ground) down to -16.7% (cruise level), and to -30.8% at ground sub-idle. Inefficient scavenging will result in a lower mass transfer rate in the oil system. This was assessed as a possible root cause for an elevated oil temperature. Upon subsequent engine removal due to event 4022515 on 17-September 2012, the remainder of the oil system was inspected and no other potential root causes were identified. It is concluded that the High Oil temperature and subsequent IFSD on 15-August occurred due to an inefficient scavenge pump. The subsequent engine removal due to event 4022515 on 17-September 2012 was assessed as unrelated to the high oil temperature. ISRO Ref. 123475 and  RSD Ref. 1333 were closed on the basis of the information provided. Recommendations: With satisfactory service history and no known issues on this part number, no further action is required, Tech Services will log the details of this event and continue to monitor the fleet. Regards, Joseph Clark IAE International Aero Engines AG Technical Services, HPC Repair Phone:+49 33708 6 2890 Fax:+49 33708 6 3313 e-mail: JClark@iaev2500.com _______________________________ This email message and any attachments are for the sole use of the intended recipient and may contain proprietary and/or confidential information which may be legally privileged or otherwise protected from disclosure.
